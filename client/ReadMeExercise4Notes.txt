Goal of the Exercise: Generate Memes with AI assistance

The user's input appears at the first half of the meme and the AI generated text fills in for the second half
An example of a generated meme is included as 'WinneMemeGENERATED' 

The future goal was to have it so that the user can choose between different meme formats, but only the one format was completed within the timeframe
The text fills the empty area by the image and the font changes between the two different responses
